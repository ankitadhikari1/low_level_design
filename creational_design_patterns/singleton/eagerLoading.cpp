//Eager Loading (Early Initialization)


/*
In Eager Loading, the instance is created at the time of class loadingâ€”even if it's not used.
This makes it thread-safe by default and simple to implement in C++.
*/

/*
-- in this we will create a private instance and move our constructor to private
-- delete copy constructor and assignment operator
--create a static method to get instance this will return the same instance to all the calls
--Initialize the eager-loaded singleton instance
