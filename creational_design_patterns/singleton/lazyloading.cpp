//lazy loading (on demand initialization)


/*
In Lazy Loading, the singleton instance is created only when it's first accessed, rather than at program start. This:
Saves memory if the instance is never used
Requires handling for thread safety (though weâ€™ll keep it simple for single-threaded use here)
*/

/*
-- in this we will create a private instance pointer and move our constructor to private
-- delete copy constructor and assignment operator
--create a static method to get instance this will return the same instance to all the calls
--Initialize the eager-loaded singleton instance to null

when object is initialised for the first time it will create a instance and afterwards 
we will just return already created instance
